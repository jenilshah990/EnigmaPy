# Enigma Simulator in Python
The current Enigma simulator allows encryption and decryption of Enigma ciphers. You can create historically accurate 3 rotor Enigma Machines ranging from Enigma A,B, M3, M4, Navy, German Rail etc. or you own custom configurations. The main aim of the project was to provide freedom and power in the hands of creator & hence we allow custom Plugboard settings, rotor wirings, ring settings, notch settings & reflector settings. The current implamentation more custom freedom than any previous implamentation of the machine. 
Note: We have developed an algorithm to increase the number of rotors to user defined numbers and will implement it in near future if enough request come. 
# Caution:
The current machine is just for eductional purposes. It is strong enough to be used as encryption based on 3x10^114 configuration. However,it hasn't been rigourously tested for cyber attacks and is really susceptible.
